         <p>I've always enjoyed cooking and experimenting with new ingredients and techniques to make great and enjoyable meals. I began cooking with my mother when I was approximately eight years old. My mother taught me to cook. It is always enjoyable and exciting to be in the kitchen, preparing satisfying meals. Because I have children, I prepare meals at home every day. You can use your creativity to create your own recipes as you cook. You are free to pick your own ingredients and how you want to cook them.</p>
         <p>I've always tried cooking various foods like Nepalese, Indian, Chinese, American, and Italian cuisines, all of which have a wonderful and relaxing flavor. Since I learned these skills from my mother, I also want to pass them on to my children. As a result, I ask them to help me when I cook. For example, I ask my son to roll the dough while I make roti, crack the eggs when I make omelets, spread the cheese and vegetables on the pizza, and fill and wrap the dumplings when I make dumplings. He also likes helping in the kitchen.</p>

         <p>So far, I've made a variety of foods, but momo, commonly known as dumplings, is one of my all-time favorite Nepali dishes because it is packed with healthy veggies like onions, cabbage, cilantro, spring onions, garlic, etc. Dumplings can be made vegetarian, with chicken, or with any kind of meat filling. They are usually made during the rainy or winter season, as they can give warmth to the body when served with chicken soup. Below is the recipe for preparing delicious chicken momos.</p>
